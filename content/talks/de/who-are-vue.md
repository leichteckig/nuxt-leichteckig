## Abstract

In the ever-evolving landscape of modern single-page applications, VueJS stands out, but it also presents us with challenges. Among them, authentication is a crucial one: ensuring the user's identity and securing their journey within your application. Fear not, though; we're here to guide you through these exciting frontiers.

In our session, we'll unravel the secrets of authentication in VueJS applications, making it a delightful learning journey for everyone while keeping the focus on the most important parts. We'll provide an overview of an authentication flow, break down each step, and demystify the role of JWT tokens in the process.

Whether you're a seasoned VueJS developer or just getting started, you're in for a treat. A dash of prior experience with user authentication certainly doesn't hurt, but it's optional. We welcome all, no prior knowledge is necessary â€“ bring your curiosity and enthusiasm to explore the world of user authentication!
